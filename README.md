# Project: Association


## [Collaborative Project]

This project requests you to build on the top of existing project.


## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- Add descriptive README file to your repositories.
- Use meaningful names for your Pull Requests and add a short summary of its content.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit files that are not related to the project. Instead, add them to [.gitignore file].
- Do not commit inline comments. They will make your project look messy. If you need to review a previous version of your code, you can always use git history.

### Project specific

Before you start working on this project, familiarize yourself with the MVP term. Please keep it in mind - first, you want to build something simple that will work. After the core features are implemented, you can improve your app.

Here is a description of business requirements for your app:

We need to build a social media app called “Stay in touch”.

As a guest user:

- I want to be able to create account/log in.
- I can see only “Sign in” and “Sign out” page.

As a logged-in user:

- I want to be able to see all users list.
- I want to be able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).
- I want to be able to send a friendship invitation.
- I want to see a button “Invite to friendship” next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users’ list and single user page.
- I want to be able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
- I want to be able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
- I want to be able to create new posts (text only).
- I want to be able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
- I want to be able to add comments to posts.
- I want to be able to see “Timeline” page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).
- Timeline page should be the root page of the app.
